\section{Introduction}
Automatically extracting events from natural text remains a challenging task in information extraction. Among diverse types of event extraction systems, the event extraction task proposed by Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) \cite{doddington2004automatic} program is the most popular corpus for testing new event extraction algorithms. The ACE program defines the two terminologies for event extraction: \textbf{trigger} and \textbf{argument}. The former one is the word that most clearly expresses the occurrence of an event. The latter one is a named entity that serves as a participant or attribute with a specific role in an event.

However, constructing this corpus is expensive. First, expert linguists are required to summarize a large amount of text to elaborately design templates about potential arguments for each event type. Second, rules should be explicitly stated to guide annotators. In spite of detailed annotation guidelines, there is still some disagreement between human annotators about what should (not) be regarded as triggers. For example, can a prepositional phrase trigger an event, like ``in prison'' triggers an \emph{arrest} event? Or can a portion of a word be a trigger, like ``ex'' in ``ex-husband'' triggers a \emph{divorce} event?
Besides, ACE event extraction systems remain two major limitations:  first, they focus on simplified scenario of single-token trigger labeling; second, they assume that an event has only one type.

The aforementioned drawbacks of ACE event extraction systems motivate us to (1) investigate the feasibility of automatic data generation, and (2) address the event extraction task in a more realistic scenario where annotated arguments are almost phrases, and some events have more than one types.
First, we draw the inspiration from our observations on knowledge base (KB). A knowledge base stores complex structured information, and some of which shares a highly similar structure with event templates defined in ACE. Thus, any sentence that contains some participants and attributes in a particular KB entry is likely to imply an event in some way. On the other hand, recent studies \cite{mintz2009distant,zeng2015distant} have demonstrated the effectiveness of KB as distant supervision for binary relation extraction, which is another important task in information extraction. However, there is two major challenges when leveraging KB to event extraction: first, relations between an event and its arguments are more complex than binary relations. They can be represented as $\langle event\_type, argument_1, \ldots, argument_n\rangle$, which are n-ary relations with various numbers of entities. Second, there is no trigger information in any existing knowledge base. 
Therefore, we explore datasets generated based on different hypotheses about arguments to avoid the noise caused by the absence of triggers, and select the one that best fits in both quality and quantity (see Section~\ref{datagen}). Among these hypotheses, the vital one is that, for a particular event type, there are some relevant arguments, called \textbf{key arguments}, which together can trigger an event of the corresponding type and distinguish it with other event types. In this paper, we utilize Freebase as the knowledge base. And we choose Wikipedia articles as texts for data generation, according to Mintz et al. \shortcite{mintz2009distant}, because a major source of Freebase is the tabular data from Wikipedia, making it a natural fit with Freebase. Figure~\ref{fig:3} illustrates two examples of sentences annotated by our algorithm.
Second, unlike previous ACE event extraction systems \cite{ahn2006stages,li2013joint,chen2015event,nguyen2016joint}, which regard event extraction as a classification problem, we split event extraction into two sequence labeling subtasks, namely event detection and argument detection. Following the fashion in other sequence labeling tasks, like POS tagging and NER \cite{huang2015bidirectional,lample2016neural}, we utilize a LSTM-CRF model to label key arguments and non-key arguments in the sentences separately. However, based on the above hypothesis, LSTM-CRF is not a flawless solution, as the structure of an event is not sequential and there are strong dependencies between key arguments with respect to the same event type. Therefore, we reformulate the hypotheses as constraints and apply linear integer programming on the output scores produced by LSTM-CRF to get the global optimization. After this post inference, to tackle with the multiple events and multi-type events issue, we propose a heuristic method to iteratively generate multiple labeling sequences. Finally, we conduct both manual and automatic evaluation for the detected events.

In this paper, we first intend to employ Freebase as distant supervision to label event structures from text without the need of human annotator. To address the problem caused by the absence of trigger information in Freebase, we propose four hypotheses about the relations between event arguments and Freebase instances. Then we propose a LSTM-CRF model with post inference to extract general events and multi-type events on the generated dataset, which is demonstrated effective by both manual and automatic evaluation.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our data generation methods, and Section 3 introduces our models of extracting events. Section 4 provides the experimental results and analyses. Section 5 discusses related work. Section 6 concludes this paper.
