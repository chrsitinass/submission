Existing event extraction systems are supervised and often learned from expert-annotated datasets, such as ACE and ERE event extraction program. However, constructing these high-quality corpora is costly, and manually annotated dataset are limited in size and coverage of event types, which makes models learned on these datasets hard to generalize. Inspired by some Freebase schemas which share similar structures with ACE event templates, we investigate the following problems in this paper: can we generate a feasible dataset for event extraction with Freebase automatically and is it possible to extract events on this dataset. We first propose four hypotheses based on our observation and produce our dataset accordingly. Then, we design a neural network model with ILP-based post inference committing to handling two challenging problems in event extraction: multi-type events and multi-word arguments. Finally, manual evaluation demonstrates that the data we generated are feasible, and experimental results of both manual and automatic evaluation prove the effectiveness of our proposed model.
