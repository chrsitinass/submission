Existing event extraction systems are often supervised and rely on expert-annotated datasets, with limited event types.
%such as ACE and ERE event extraction frameworks. 
However, designing and constructing these 
high-quality corpora, usually with limited size and coverage of event types,  is costly, which 
makes learned extractors hard to generalize.  With the essence of distant supervision, 
%Inspired by some Freebase schemas which share similar structures with ACE event templates, 
we investigate the possibilities of automatic construction of training data for various event types 
with the help of structured knowledge bases. 
%the following problems in this paper: can we generate a feasible dataset for event extraction with Freebase automatically and is it possible to extract events on this dataset. 
%We first propose four hypotheses based on our observation and produce our dataset accordingly. Then, 
We further propose a novel neural network with ILP-based post inference committing to 
handling two challenges in event extraction: multi-type events and multi-word arguments. 
Both automatic and manual evaluations demonstrate that it is possible to learn to extract various  events, according to existing knowledge bases, without human-annotated training data.
